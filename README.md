This code is an in browser javascript code to extract the facebook market place result and save it in a CSV file in order to use it in an excel based (or Power Queery, or data analysis pipelines) query.

The excel file will do a regression by fitting a polynomial and exponential function to the data and checks all data against the estiamted function. What ever stands above the fitted data will be marked as red and others will be untouched. 

The final decision may be taken by choosing non-highlighted items who have larger calculated numbers (after sorting DESC)
